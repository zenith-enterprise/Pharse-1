    "summary": "1) The portfolio shows a slight gain of 5.63% with a commendable diversification score of 84. However, there is a significant risk mismatch as it lacks equity exposure despite the investor's high-risk profile, and there is a high concentration in a single fund.\n\n2) Recommendations for the client:\n   - Introduce equity exposure to the portfolio to align it with the high-risk profile, potentially improving growth opportunities.\n   - Diversify holdings further by reducing concentration in Kotak Mahindra and exploring additional funds to minimize risk associated with over-dependence on a single asset."
