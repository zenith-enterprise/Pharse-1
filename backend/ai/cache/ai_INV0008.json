    "summary": "**Portfolio Health Summary:**\nThe investor's portfolio currently shows a -11.73% loss despite a significant asset under management (AUM) of approximately $1,074,282. The portfolio has an excellent diversification score of 92, but there is a notable risk mismatch, with no equity allocation despite a high-risk profile, which also contributes to a high churn risk.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n1. **Rebalance the Portfolio:** Advise the client to consider increasing their equity exposure to align with their high-risk profile, which could enhance growth potential in the long run. Review the existing funds for underperformance and suggest reallocating into suitable equity mutual funds.\n\n2. **Monitor Alerts and Performance:** Recommend closely monitoring the flagged funds, particularly the underperforming debt funds. Consider replacing them with better-performing alternatives to improve overall portfolio stability and reduce potential losses."
