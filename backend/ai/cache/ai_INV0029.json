    "summary": "**Portfolio Health Summary:**  \nThe investor's portfolio, with an asset under management (AUM) of \u20b91,368,553.21, is currently experiencing a loss of 10.05%. The high level of churn risk indicates potential instability, while a diversification score of 92 suggests a good spread across various funds. However, immediate attention is required due to alerts from several funds.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**  \n1. **Review Underperforming Funds:** Advise the client to assess the flagged funds, such as HDFC Mutual Fund Debt Fund and Axis Mutual Fund Equity Fund, and consider reallocating investments to higher-performing options or more stable funds to improve overall returns and mitigate losses.\n\n2. **Enhance Diversification Strategy:** Suggest increasing exposure to different asset classes or sectors to reduce risk and enhance the potential for growth, especially considering the current high churn risk in the portfolio."
