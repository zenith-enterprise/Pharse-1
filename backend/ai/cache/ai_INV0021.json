    "summary": "**Portfolio Health Summary:**  \nThe investor's portfolio has an assets under management (AUM) of \u20b9588,174.2, but it has experienced a loss of 11.28%. With a high churn risk and complete diversification, attention is needed to stabilize the portfolio and improve returns.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**  \n1. **Reassess the Core Holdings:** Suggest reviewing the performance and suitability of the funds that have triggered alerts, particularly the Axis Mutual Fund Debt Fund and the Kotak Mahindra Liquid Fund, to identify potential underperformers and replace them with better options that align with the investor's risk tolerance and financial goals.  \n2. **Consider Risk Management Strategies:** Recommend introducing more balanced investment strategies, possibly reallocating some funds towards growth-oriented equity mutual funds if the investor's risk tolerance allows, to help recover losses and enhance long-term capital growth."
