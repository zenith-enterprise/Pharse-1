    "summary": "1) The portfolio shows a negative gain of \u20b9-34,569.07, indicating a drop in value and presents a high concentration risk with 70.64% of the assets invested in DSP Mutual Fund, leading to reduced diversification at only 40%. Additionally, there is a significant risk mismatch as the investor's profile suggests a high risk tolerance but has no equity exposure.\n\n2) \n   - Suggest the client diversify their portfolio by reallocating funds from the heavily concentrated DSP Mutual Fund to other asset classes like equity, which could align with their high-risk profile and potentially promote growth.\n   - Recommend reducing the churn risk by maintaining a balanced portfolio that minimizes high concentration in any single fund, thus improving overall portfolio stability and mitigating potential losses."
