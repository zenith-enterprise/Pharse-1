    "summary": "1) The portfolio has an Asset Under Management (AUM) of \u20b9909,600.32 but is underperforming with a slight loss of \u20b910.66. It's fully diversified but exhibits a significant risk mismatch, as it holds no equity despite the investor\u2019s high-risk profile.\n\n2) \n- Recommend increasing equity exposure to align the portfolio with the investor's high-risk profile, which could help enhance potential growth.\n- Suggest reviewing and rebalancing the funds with alerts, particularly those that may be underperforming or contributing to the churn risk, to improve overall portfolio performance."
