    "summary": "1) The portfolio has an Asset Under Management (AUM) of \u20b9786,409.42 and has incurred a loss of \u20b910.24, indicating that it may not be performing well currently. The diversification level is at 72, which is healthy, but the high churn risk suggests the client may frequently alter their investments.\n\n2) \n- **Rebalance the Portfolio**: Recommend reassessing the current mutual fund allocations, particularly considering the five funds flagged in alerts.  It may be prudent to replace any funds that are consistently underperforming or carry high churn risks to enhance stability and performance.\n- **Focus on Growth Options**: Encourage the client to explore higher growth potential mutual funds (such as equity or hybrid funds) to counterbalance the losses and improve returns, while ensuring that it aligns with their risk tolerance."
